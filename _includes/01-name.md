# Elizabeth Yorick - Nature Photographer



### I love to photograph **EVERYTHING** in Nature!



I photograph Landscapes, Animal Portraits, Animal Candids, etc.  If it's in Nature, I probably photograph it.  A lot of my photographs are taken from a moving vehicle. If you wonder how I can do that, check out my blog at https://lizyorick.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/
